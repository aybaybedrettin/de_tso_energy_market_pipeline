# Power BI Dashboard â€” German Energy Market

This folder contains the interactive Power BI dashboard built for visualizing key aspects of the German electricity market. It connects to a PostgreSQL database containing structured and cleaned data downloaded from SMARD.de.

## Files

- `EnergyDashboard.pbix`  
  The full Power BI dashboard with data snapshot included.

- `EnergyDashboardTemplate.pbit`  
  A clean Power BI template that retains all visuals, measures, filters, and structure, but does not include any data. Use this to connect to your own PostgreSQL instance.

- `screenshots/`  
  Contains 5 preview images of the dashboard for quick reference without opening the Power BI files.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard enables analysis across four German control zones:

- **50Hertz**
- **Amprion**
- **TenneT**
- **TransnetBW**

It provides insights on:

- Monthly electricity generation by source
- Total system load per zone
- Redispatch and congestion management costs
- Day-ahead electricity prices
- Price volatility and classification
